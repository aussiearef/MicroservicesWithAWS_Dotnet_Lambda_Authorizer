Although microservice code is part of an online course called ["Build Microservices with .NET and Amazon Web Services"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-microservices-with-aspnet-core-amazon-web-services/?referralCode=B288BF33506B34292176), it can be used as an example code to demonstrate how a Lambda Authorizer is developed. You can even update the code a little bit and fit it for your own purpose. 


The course explains how a microservices-based system is developed and what relevant design patterns are applied in any given scenarios.
